# Walmart-Predictive-ML
The data scientists at Walmart have collected sales data for one thousand five hundred and fifty-nine products across ten stores in different cities. Furthermore, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined.

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model and find the sales figures of each product at a particular store.

Using a **Linear Regression** model, Wallmart will try to understand the properties of products and stores, which play a key role in increasing sales.

**Problem Statement**
What could affect the target variable "sales"?

* Time of the week
* Time of the day
* Time of the year
* Store size
* Store location
* The item in question

**Solution Steps**

Step 1: Made a hypothesis about the data without looking at it

Step 2: Moved on the data exploration and found some nuances in the dat which required remediation

Step 3: Performed data cleaning and feature engineering and imputed the missing values and solved other irregularities

Step 4: Made new features and also made the data model-friendly using one-hot encoding

Step 5: Built a regression model

At the end, the RMSE score of 1126.24 is achieved.
